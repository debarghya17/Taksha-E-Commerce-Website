      content: `
      <p>In the heart of our workshop, where the scent of freshly cut wood mingles with the rhythmic sounds of traditional tools, Rajesh Kumar breathes life into each creation. With over three decades of experience, Rajesh preserves age-old woodworking techniques passed down through generations.</p>

      <p>Rajesh shared that every piece he creates carries a story — a story of the wood, the hands that shaped it, and the culture it represents. He believes that preserving these techniques is crucial to maintaining the soul of the craft in a rapidly changing world.</p>

      <p>By combining innovation with respect for tradition, Rajesh and his team ensure that each product is not just a functional item but a piece of living heritage.</p>
